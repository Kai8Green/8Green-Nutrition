# 8Green-Nutrition

This repository holds an Excel spreadsheet based on RP Nutrition guidelines but within the metric system and with variations for formulas. I decided to upload this after getting a number of requests from friends for access to it.

I understand that not everyone has access to Excel, so I've included a shared link below for Google Sheets that is free with a Google account.

To get a copy for yourself, you can download as an .xlsx file or make a copy. To make a copy from within the Google Sheet file, follow the steps below:

1. Go to 'File' menu tab
2. Select 'Make a Copy'
3. Rename to your preferred choice.
4. Open document and you are ready to go.

Make sure to retain a copy of the master file so that if you run into an errors or unexpected errors that you have a clean slate.

Anyone can make moderations to this file. I have only locked cells to prevent unintended modification of formulas. You can remove these locks. Anyone who makes amendments - builds, improves or reviews formula data on this document and is willing to share it back, please send up and I will review for version. 

We grow together.
